# List of Owl System Libraries and Object Methods

Owl contains a set of built-in system libraries that are usable on any platform. Some of these libraries, such as math and profiler, must be imported in order to be used. Others, like _tuple and _list, define the methods of specific types of objects; in this case, tuple and list objects, respectively. You shouldn't need to import these libraries defining object methods directly.

Libraries:

-   [Built-in library](Built-in_library "wikilink")
-   [math](Math "wikilink")
-   [profiler](Profiler "wikilink")
-   [sys](Sys "wikilink")
-   [time](Time "wikilink")
-   [types](Types "wikilink")

Libraries defining object methods:

-   [_dict](Dictionaries "wikilink")
-   [_list](Lists "wikilink")
-   [_set](Sets "wikilink")
-   [_str](Strings "wikilink")
-   [_tuple](Tuples "wikilink")
