Using and distributing the Owl Embedded Python Environment:

Owl is the product of several years of development by the Rice Computer
Architecture Group at Rice University and a collection of wonderful open-source
software projects. Combined, they provide an open-source environment for
programming microcontrollers that is easy and free to use.

This release combines work from:

 - Dean Hall's Python-on-a-Chip (http://code.google.com/p/python-on-a-chip/)
 - libffi (http://sourceware.org/libffi/)
 - Python (http://python.org/)
 - libopencm3 (http://www.libopencm3.org/)

Each source file contains a header that explains the license that applies to
that particular file. The majority of the system (including the complete
virtual machine and library) is provided under the liberal MIT license. The FFI
subsystem is provided under the libffi license, which is identical to the MIT
license.

However, some support code, including but not limited to, the linker scripts
for the Stellaris microcontrollers, are provided under the GNU Lesser GPL. This
license is compatible with the MIT license with some exceptions.

Any user wishing to redistribute Owl should ensure that he or she is complying
with the licenses for all the code contained therein.
