The Owl Embedded Python System is a free and open-source system for programming
small 32-bit microcontrollers in Python. It is dramatically easier to use than
other programming environments for microcontrollers, while still powerful
enough to build just about anything. Try it out today!

Owl is currently in a limited release. Right now, we have released VM binaries
for TI Stellaris microcontrollers and the user toolchain as well as the
complete source code. This is enough to get started programming
microcontrollers, though there are more pieces yet to be released.

You can find the Owl documentation, binaries and toolchains on our website at
[embeddedpython.org](http://embeddedpython.org/). Most users should start there and only need the
content on BitBucket if they're interested in porting or modifying Owl. If you
have any questions about Owl, contact us at [twb@embeddedpython.org](mailto:twb@embeddedpython.org).
